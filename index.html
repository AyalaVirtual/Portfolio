                <h3>Web Design</h3>
                <p>Web design is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and arranging content online. The different areas of web design include web graphic design, user interface design (UI design), and user experience design (UX design). Designing a website goes beyond aesthetics to include the websiteâ€™s overall functionality. Web design also includes web apps, mobile apps, and user interface design.</p>
                <p>Your website is the foundation of your online presence, but it's just one of 1.88 billion websites that are currently on the internet. I help you stand out from your competitors, whether you need a new website built, or just a redesign of an existing site.</p>

                <h3>Software Development</h3>
                <p>Software development is the process of creating a piece of software designed to perform a particular task.</p>
                <p>Front end and back end development involves different skill sets and technologies. Front end development is programming which focuses on the visual elements of a website or app that a user will interact with (the client side). Meanwhile, back end development focuses on the side of a website users can't see (the server side). For this reason, software developers are usually classified as front end, back end or full stack developers. I am a full-stack developer, which means I have the skills and experience to work on both the client (front end) and server (back end) sides.</p>

                <h3>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h3>
                <p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process used to optimize a website's technical configuration, content relevance, and link popularity (backlinks) so its pages can become easily findable, more relevant and popular towards user search queries, and as a result, they rank higher on search engine results pages (SERPs).</p>
                <p>With almost 2 billion websites on the internet today, it's become increasingly hard for potential customers to find yours amongst all the clutter. Using white hat SEO techniques and meticulous keyword research, I help generate more website traffic, leads, and sales by making your content more visible to major search engines.</p>

                <p>Content strategy is an essential part of inbound marketing as it can be used for social media marketing, as well as social or behavior change marketing.</p>
                <p>The average person spends approximately 3 hours per day on social media, making it an effective tool to utilize in your marketing strategy. Staying connected with your audience through the use of social media is an essential part of your online marketing strategy. I help you reach your target audience through strategic and well-planned content, attracting new clients and nurturing your existing ones with engaging branded content.</p>    
                <p>Through the use of social marketing (also known as behavior change marketing), we can build awareness about social issues.

                <h3>Marketing Analytics</h3>
                <p>One of the major advantages of digital marketing is that it is highly trackable and measurable. These analytics allow marketers to track user behavior, such as how many times they click on a link, how much time they spend on a web page, etc. This gives marketers insight on what is successful with consumers and adapt their content and marketing strategy moving forward. This includes measuring how your site is performing, which keywords are bringing users to your site, how users are navigating through your website, and much more.</p>
                <p>Knowing how to interpret marketing analytics can help marketers quickly cut campaigns that arenâ€™t working and build better campaigns around concepts that have a proven track record of success. The analytics will also inform and improve your campaigns.</p>
